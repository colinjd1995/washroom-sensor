# washroom-sensor
This repo houses a project to detect when the washer and dryer have completed their loads and alerts house occupants. 

The system will utilize a Raspberry Pi Zero W to connect to a RPi acting as a server that will take the sensor data collected by the Zero and will populate a webpage with information for the user to decide whether to go collect their laundry.
